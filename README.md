### Keyboard modifications

#### vim-style navigation with `xmodmap`

Init script will create a symbolic link from `~/.Xmodmap` to `~/.dotfiles/config/x/.Xmodmap`, which provides vim-style cursor / mouse pointer navigation:

From | To
--- | ---
`Caps_Lock` | `Mode_switch`
`Shift + Caps_Lock` | `Caps_Lock`
`Caps_Lock + 4` | line end
`Caps_Lock + 0` | line start
`Caps_Lock + h` | cursor left
`Caps_Lock + j` | cursor down
`Caps_Lock + k` | cursor up
`Caps_Lock + l` | cursor right
`Caps_Lock + x` | delete

Some modifications require accessibility feature to work:

From | To
--- | ---
`Caps_Lock + s` | mouse pointer left
`Caps_Lock + d` | mouse pointer down
`Caps_Lock + f` | mouse pointer up
`Caps_Lock + g` | mouse pointer right
`Caps_Lock + v` | mouse button 1
`Caps_Lock + b` | mouse button 2
`Caps_Lock + n` | mouse button 3

#### More escapes with `xcape`

Drop the below line to `.xinitrc`, after `xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap` line to have short press of `Caps_Lock` and `Control_L` to dispatch `Esc` key instead.

```
xcape -e 'Control_L=Escape;Mode_switch=Escape'
```
