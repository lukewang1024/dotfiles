# Alacritty Config Customization

Create `local.toml` in this folder, then add your customization there.

## Font

Font family names might be different on different OS, so it is a good candidate for `local.toml`.

- macOS

```toml
[font.normal]
family = "MesloLGS Nerd Font"
```

- Windows / Linux

```toml
[font.normal]
family = "MesloLGS NF"
```
